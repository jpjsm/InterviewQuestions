## Delete all files and folder inside a given folder. 
## -  Any files inside a subfolder will have to be deleted as well.

## You are working on the implementation of a new OS. 
## Your team has completed the functions to: 
## -  list all filesystem objects at the given path: listfiles(<file-path>)
## -  delete a file from the filesystem: deletefile(<file-path>)
## -  delete an empty folder from the filesystem deleteemptyfolder(<folder-path>)
## -  check if path is file: isfile(<file-path>)
## -  check if path is folder: isfolder(<file-path>)
