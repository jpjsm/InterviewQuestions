# Triplets with Sum Zero

Given a list of integers (positive and negative), return the position in the
list of all triplets that sum zero; indices should be in ascending order.

For example:

Given the list [1, 2, 0, -1, -3]

The answer should be:

- [0, 1, 4] -> [1, 2, -3]
- [0, 2, 3] -> [1, 0, -1]
