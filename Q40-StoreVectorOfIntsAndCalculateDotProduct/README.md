# Store Vector of Numbers and Calculate Dot Product

Design a data structure to store a sparse vector of numbers and
efficiently calculate the dot product of 2 such vectors.

- Assume the vectors have dimension in the hundreds of million elements,
but only a few thousands have values different than zero.

- Assume the distribution of the values different than zero is uniform
throughout the indices.
