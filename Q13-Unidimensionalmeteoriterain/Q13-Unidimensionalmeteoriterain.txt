Assume you are in a speceship and a unidimensional rain of meteorites 
is ahead of the spaceship.

Determine if one or more meteorites will hit the spaceship and 
the (speed, size) of them.

The rain of meteorites is represented by a list of pairs: speed and size. 
  --> All speeds are in the same unit system
  --> all masses are in the same unit system.

A negative speed means approaching (or reducing distance to) spaceship; 
positive speed means running away from spaceship.

When two meteorites collide: 
-  momentums (speed * mass) are compared to determine final direction 
   of colliding results, largest momentum wins
-  new mass is the absolute value of the difference in masses
-  new momentum is the difference of the momentums
-  new speed is the quotient of new momentum divided by new mass
