# Combinations and Permutations

## Permutations

Write function that returns all permutations, of length 'n', from the members
of a list of items; the paramenter `allow_repetitions` controls where items can
be repeated in a permutation, by default `allow_repetitions` should be `False`.
If length is zero, permutations should be for all items.

## Combinations

Write function that returns all combinations, of length 'n', from the members
of a list of items`. If length is zero, permutations should be for all items.
