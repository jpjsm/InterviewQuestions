# Find a solution for 1/N as the sum of unit fractions

Given a number `N` (where N ∈ natural numbers), and `k` the number of unit
fractions required to sum.

Find the value of the letters {a,b,c,d,e,..., z}

Where:

- $1/N = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c + ... 1/z$
- $D = \{a,b,c,...,z\}$ and $a,b,c,d,...,z ∈ ℕ$
- $|D| = k$ (the number of elements in $D$ is $k$)
