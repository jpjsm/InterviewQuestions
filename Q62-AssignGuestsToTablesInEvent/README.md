# Asssign Guests to Tables at Event

## Level 1

At the event, tables are set in a way they can seat 8 people in each table. And
there's a fixed number of tables.

Some of the tables have people assigned to them. If any of those persons aren't
in the list of guests, you have to remove them from the table. If a person at
the table is in the list, make sure is not assigned more than once.

- What data structures would you use for the list of guests and the tables?
- Define a function to help you assign the seats to the guests in the list.
- What edge cases can you identify?
- Design a collection of unit tests (functional tests, not argument validations).

## Level 2

If there's time, what changes would you do if some guests need to be seated
together at the same table?

- What edge cases can you identify?
- What changes would you do to the already defined data structures?

## Level 3

if there's even more time, tables are now grouped by guests affinity.

What changes would you do to accomodate the new requirement?

- What edge cases can you identify?
