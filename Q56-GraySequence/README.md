# Gray Sequence

Definition of [Gray code](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code>) or Gray
sequence:

> *The reflected binary code (RBC), also known as reflected binary (RB) or Gray
code after Frank Gray, is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two
successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit).*
> *For example, the representation of the decimal value "1" in binary would
normally be "001", and "2" would be "010". In Gray code, these values are
represented as "001" and "011". That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2
requires only one bit to change, instead of two.*

Create a function that generates a Gray sequence of a given number of bits.
