# Find the First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer. Zero
is not part of possitive integers.

For example,

- Given [1, 2, 0] return 3,
- Given [3, 4, -1, 1] return 2.
- Given [4, 8, 2, 1, 0, -1, 5] return 3.

The solution should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.
