Define a function that lists all tasks in a project, in a single line, in a way that when a task is executed from the list, all pre-requisites tasks have been executed (or are listed to the left of the task, in the list). If such list cannot be constructed, the function should report it.

Assume that for each task, only the immediate pre-requisites are known.

What is the signature of the function 'SingleLineTaskList'?
