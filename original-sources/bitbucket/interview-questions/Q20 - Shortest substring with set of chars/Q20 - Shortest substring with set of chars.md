# Q20 - Shortest substring with set of chars

Given a string of text and a set of characters, find the shortest substring
that contains all chars in the given set; repetitions are allowed in the substring
or other chars not in the set. If no solution is found return an empty string.

For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the set {'a', 'b', 'c'}
the shortest substring with all characters in the set is "brac".
