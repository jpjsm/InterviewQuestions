Given a list of cities and population (in millions), return a random city name based on population weight.

Function signature:
RandomState()
- returns string with state name

Assume your input is a list with the information in the following table:
 
City     | Population 
         | (millions) 
---------+------------
Alpha    |      1     
Bravo    |      2     
Charlie  |      4     
Delta    |      8     
Echo     |     16     
Foxtrot  |     32     

If you run your random function a thousand times and collect the frequencies 
for the labels, you should get results similar to this output:

('Alpha',     15)
('Bravo',     24)
('Charlie',   73)
('Delta',    125)
('Echo',     245)
('Foxtrot',  518)

The results, above, make sense once you calculate the percentage of the cities 
population weight when compared to the total population.

City     | Population | Pct Weight
         | (millions) |
---------+------------+------------
Alpha    |      1     |     1.6%
Bravo    |      2     |     3.2%
Charlie  |      4     |     6.3%
Delta    |      8     |    12.7%
Echo     |     16     |    25.4%
Foxtrot  |     32     |    50.8%
