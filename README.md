# Interview Questions

A place to store the interview questions I have been asked to solve, or the
ones I have used to interview candidates.

My idea is to have each question title and body in this document (README.md)
and the solutions in subfolders, by question title; solutions could be in
different coding languages.

## Questions

## Notes

- In the beginning, I'm using the `original-sources` folder to collect the all
the questions I have from different computers, places, etc.
- Slowly, but certain, things will be migrated to their rightful places:
questions will be enunciated in this document, and solutions in their
corresponding subfolders.
