# Interview Questions

## Introduction

This is the place where I have collected most of the interview questions
that I had asked to candidates, or that have been asked to me as a candidate.

It's hard to tell the origin of some of the questions, as I saved the question
from the interview (without stating the source a the moment I saved the question).
Some of these questions are 15+ years old; therefore, impossible to track down the source.

> **My apologies to the authors of these questions for not mentioning them!!**

What I can do is mention the source books that I have used over the years to prepare
for the interviews that I had taken, whether they are interview books, or text books.

About the interview questions that I had used to interview candidates...
Something similar had happened here; some of the interview questions were taken 
from the books I have (i.e. the check for palindrome, or find the all the anagram groups
from a list of words), but the questions were tweaked to measure something else and
they differ from the original in any of the sources.

I'll do my best to search in my sources and give proper credit to the authors while
reorganizing this repo.

Here's the list of books on interviews, problem solving, and textbooks used to get interview
questions: [Bibliography](./bibliography.md)

## The Questions

### [Q00 Weighted Random](Q00-WeightedRandom/Q00-WeightedRandom.txt)

Given a list of cities and population (in millions), return a random city name based on population weight.

### [Q01A Find Anagrams](Q01A-FindAnagrams/Q01-FindAnagrams.txt)

Find all anagram groups from a list of words

### [Q01B Find palindromes and almost palindromes]()

Find which words from a given list are palindromes.

What changes need to be done to the IsPalindrome method to test if a word is almost palindrome. An almost palindrome is a word that would be a palindrome if one character is removed.

### [Q01C Find all permutations with repetitions](Q01C-Findallpermutationswithrepetitions/Q01C-Findallpermutationswithrepetitions.txt)

Given a set of items, or list of items without repetitions.
Generate all permutations of size N for the elements of the set with repetitions.
