# Interview Questions

This is the place where I have collected most of the interview questions
that I had asked to candidates, or that have been asked to me as a candidate.

It's hard to tell the origin of some of the questions, as I saved the question
from the interview (without stating the source a the moment I saved the question).
Some of these questions are 15+ years old; therefore, impossible to track down the source.

> **My apologies to the authors of these questions for not mentioning them!!**

What I can do is mention the source books that I have used over the years to prepare
for the interviews that I had taken, whether they are interview books, or text books.

About the interview questions that I had used to interview candidates...
Something similar had happened here; some of the interview questions were taken 
from the books I have (i.e. the check for palindrome, or find the all the anagram groups
from a list of words), but the questions were tweaked to measure something else and
they differ from the original in any of the sources.

I'll do my best to search in my sources and give proper credit to the authors while
reorganizing this repo.
