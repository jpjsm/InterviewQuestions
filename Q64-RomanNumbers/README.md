# Roman and Decimal Numbers

## Roman numbers

Taken from: [Roman Numerals Description](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Description>)
in Wikipedia.

The following table displays how Roman numerals are usually written in modern
times:

> **Individual decimal places**

| | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | M | C | X | I |
| 2 | MM | CC | XX | II |
| 3 | MMM | CCC | XXX | III |
| 4 | | CD | XL | IV |
| 5 | | D | L | V |
| 6 | | DC | LX | VI |
| 7 | | DCC | LXX | VII |
| 8 | | DCCC | LXXX | VIII |
| 9 | | CM | XC | IX |

The numerals for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) are written using subtractive notation,
where the smaller symbol (I) is subtracted from the larger one (V or X), instead
of IIII and VIIII. Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400
(CD) and 900 (CM). These are the only subtractive forms in standard use.

A number containing two or more decimal digits is built by appending the Roman
numeral equivalent for each, from highest to lowest, as in the following
examples:

| Decimal | | Expression | | Notation |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 39 | = | XXX + IX | = | **XXXIX** |
| 246 | = | CC + XL + VI | = | **CCXLVI** |
| 789 | = | DCC + LXXX + IX | = | **DCCLXXXIX** |
| 2,421 | = | MM + CD + XX + I | = | **MMCDXXI** |

Any missing place (represented by a zero in the place-value equivalent) is
omitted, as in Latin (and English) speech:

| Decimal | | Expression | | Notation |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 160 | = | C + LX | = | **CLX** |
|207 = CC + VII = CCVII
|1,009 = M + IX = MIX
|1,066 = M + LX + VI = MLXVI

The largest number that can be represented in this manner is `3,999`
(**MMMCMXCIX**), but this is sufficient for the values for which Roman numerals
are commonly used today.

## Tasks

Write a function to convert a decimal number to its Roman representation and
viceversa.
