## Sudoku description and rules

### From: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku>)

> In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that
each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1
to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which, for a
well-posed puzzle, has a single solution.

> The goal of Sudoku is to fill each row, column, and 3x3 block with the numbers
1 through 9, ensuring that no number is repeated within any row, column, or
block.

![Sudoku rules to fill the puzzle](./sudoku-rules.webp)

> Each Sudoku grid has 81 cells arranged in a 9x9 layout and subdivided into
nine 3x3 blocks. At the start of each game, some of the cells will be filled
with numbers that allow you to figure out the placement of numbers in blank
cells.
